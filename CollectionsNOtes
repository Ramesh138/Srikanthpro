Arrays Vs Collections

Arrays are static in size  and collections was dynamic in size

Arrays are homogenous and collections are homogenious and hetrogenious 

Array will take more memory and collection will take less memory

Arrays can perform more than Collection 

Arryas:

int values[]={10,20,30,40,50};


List<Integer> li = new List<Integer>;

li.add(10);
li.add(20);

Collection vs Collections:

Collection – In any programming language or real life, a Collection is a group of objects (similar or different).

Collection Framework – Collection Framework in JAVA (as we are focusing on JAVA) is a hierarchical representation of classes and interfaces 
which provide the framework to deal with a group of objects. Group of objects can be a group of Strings or Integers, or a group of Objects of a particular class etc.

Collections – Collections is a utility class present in java.util package. 
It defines several utility methods like sorting and searching which are used to operate on collection. All the methods inside Collections class are static.



list :

list is a interface and implements arraylist and linkedlist

list display elements insertion order

list also includes null values

list will allow duplicates 

set 

set is a interface hashset treeset and linkedhashset

it doest allow duplicates

it will allow only one null null

it doest follow the insertion order

map

map is interface for hashmap and hashtable ,treemap
it doest allow duplicates

it will allow only one key as  null

it doest follow the insertion order



 HashTable is synchronized. HashMap is not synchronized. 
 HashTable is thread safe. HashMap is not thread safe.
